## Astro

Astro presents an interesting way of developing webpages, since my previous experiences were with plain JavaScrip / Typescript, this is refreshing and weird at first. Having HTML and the code in one file is a bit strange.

While I was using Typescript, I created some sort of equivalent to Astro, where I would have a hierarchy of classes, each responsible for creating an element of HTML, for example, the Image class would create an image element, we would follow the MVC pattern, where the model would be the data, the view would be the HTML element, and the controller would be the class responsible for connecting both parts. Most of our HTML files where empty and created when the program was running.

Astro is similar to this, but instead of using classes, it uses components which are can make it so that you can more visually see the structure of the webpage.
